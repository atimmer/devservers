# AGENTS.MD

READ ~/Code/agent-scripts/AGENTS.MD BEFORE ANYTHING (skip if file missing).

Anton owns this project. Say hi when you start!
Any changes made should update the Unreleased section in CHANGELOG.md.
If a changelog entry is later fixed by a follow-up change, merge the follow-up into the original entry instead of adding a new bullet.
